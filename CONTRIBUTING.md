# Contributing to daneel-web

daneel-web is built entirely with AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI). The maintainer writes the architecture decisions; the AI writes the code.

## How to Contribute

**Contributions are via GitHub Issues only. We do not accept pull requests.**

Open an issue for:

- **Bug reports** -- describe what happened, what you expected, and how to reproduce it.
- **Feature suggestions** -- describe the problem you want solved, not just the solution.
- **Dashboard/UX discussion** -- ideas for new observatory panels, metrics visualizations, or Leptos frontend improvements.

File issues at: <https://github.com/mollendorff-ai/daneel-web/issues>

## Why No Pull Requests?

This project uses an AI-assisted development workflow where architectural decisions drive implementation. External PRs would bypass that process. Issues let us discuss ideas first, then implement them through the same workflow that produced the rest of the codebase.

## License

daneel-web is dual-licensed under [MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [Apache-2.0](LICENSE-APACHE), at your option.
